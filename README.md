## Exercise Description

#### PyBank

<i>You will be given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.) Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:</i>
- <i> The total number of months included in the dataset </i>
- <i> The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period </i>
- <i> The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period </i>
- <i> The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period </i>
- <i> The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period </i>
- <i> In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results </i>

#### PyPoll

<i> You will be give a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following: </i>

- <i> The total number of votes cast </i>
- <i> A complete list of candidates who received votes </i>
- <i> The percentage of votes each candidate won </i>
- <i> The total number of votes each candidate won </i>
- <i> The winner of the election based on popular vote </i>
- <i> In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results </i>
