#PYPOLL
    #Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
    '''
    open csv file
    create csv reader
    skip the header
    '''

    #The total number of votes cast
    '''
    sum of index (0)
    '''
    #A complete list of candidates who received votes
    '''
    list of index(2) unique values
    '''

    #The percentage of votes each candidate won

    '''
    search data for candidate
    find all corrosponding index (0) Values
    sum them
    create a dictionary of candidates and sums 
    divide sum by the total votes cast
    create another dictionary of candidates and percentages
    format as a percent
    '''

    #The total number of votes each candidate won
    '''found above'''

    #The winner of the election based on popular vote.
    '''
    print candidate with highest number
    '''
    #In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
